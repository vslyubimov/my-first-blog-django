# First project with django - personal blog

Here is a simple blog written on Django + couple of HTML files with CSS styles + admin profile to auth. 
It's connected to sqlite file, which is created by default with django repository.

For now it is not fully CRUD project, so it will be completed in future. 

For now you can go to https://vslyubimov.pythonanywhere.com/ where this project is posted until Saturday 26 November 2022
